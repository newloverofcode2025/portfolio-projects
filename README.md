# 🎵 Advanced Audio Processing Tool

A sophisticated Python application that provides powerful audio analysis, processing, and visualization capabilities. This tool combines state-of-the-art machine learning models with traditional audio processing techniques to offer comprehensive audio manipulation features through an intuitive Streamlit interface.

## ✨ Features

### 🎤 Speech Processing
- Speech-to-Text conversion using advanced models
- Speaker diarization (who spoke when)
- Emotion detection in speech
- Accent classification
- Speech enhancement and noise reduction

### 🎼 Music Analysis
- Genre classification using deep learning
- Tempo and beat detection
- Key and chord recognition
- Instrument identification
- Music transcription (MIDI conversion)

### 📊 Audio Visualization
- Waveform visualization
- Spectrogram analysis
- Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)
- Chromagram display
- 3D frequency visualization

### 🎛️ Audio Effects & Processing
- Professional-grade audio effects (reverb, delay, etc.)
- Noise reduction and audio cleanup
- Audio mixing and mashup capabilities
- Volume normalization
- Time stretching and pitch shifting

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional, but recommended)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/newloverofcode2025/audio-processing-tool.git
cd audio-processing-tool
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```python
from src.effects import AudioProcessor

processor = AudioProcessor()
processed_audio = processor.apply_effects("input.wav", 
                                       effects=['reverb', 'delay'],
                                       parameters={'reverb_room_size': 0.8})
```
