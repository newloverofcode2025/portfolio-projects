## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/newloverofcode2025/portfolio-projects.git
cd portfolio-projects/nlp-toolkit
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download required language models:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## 💡 Usage

### Quick Start
```python
from nlp_toolkit import TextAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = TextAnalyzer()

# Analyze text
text = "I absolutely love this amazing NLP toolkit! It's incredibly useful."
results = analyzer.analyze(text)

# Get sentiment
print(f"Sentiment: {results['sentiment']}")

# Get named entities
print(f"Entities: {results['entities']}")

# Get key phrases
print(f"Key phrases: {results['key_phrases']}")
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
from nlp_toolkit import DocumentProcessor, LanguageTools

# Process a document
doc_processor = DocumentProcessor()
summary = doc_processor.summarize("path/to/document.txt")
topics = doc_processor.extract_topics(text)

# Translate text
lang_tools = LanguageTools()
translated = lang_tools.translate("Hello, world!", target_lang="es")
```

## Comprehensive Documentation

### Text Analysis

#### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the emotional tone or attitude conveyed by a piece of text. The toolkit provides a sentiment analysis module that can classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.

#### Named Entity Recognition
Named entity recognition (NER) is a technique used to identify and classify named entities in text into predefined categories such as names, locations, and organizations.

#### Part-of-Speech Tagging
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a technique used to identify the part of speech (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) of each word in a sentence.

#### Text Classification
Text classification is a technique used to classify text into predefined categories such as spam vs. non-spam emails or positive vs. negative product reviews.

#### Keyword Extraction
Keyword extraction is a technique used to identify the most important words or phrases in a piece of text.

### Document Processing

#### Text Summarization
Text summarization is a technique used to automatically summarize a piece of text into a shorter form while preserving the most important information.

#### Document Similarity
Document similarity is a technique used to measure the similarity between two or more documents.

#### Topic Modeling
Topic modeling is a technique used to identify the underlying topics or themes in a large corpus of text.

#### Document Clustering
Document clustering is a technique used to group similar documents together based on their content.

#### Content Extraction
Content extraction is a technique used to extract specific information or data from a piece of text.

### Language Tools

#### Language Detection
Language detection is a technique used to identify the language of a piece of text.

#### Machine Translation
Machine translation is a technique used to automatically translate text from one language to another.

#### Grammar Checking
Grammar checking is a technique used to identify grammatical errors in a piece of text.

#### Text Correction
Text correction is a technique used to correct spelling and grammatical errors in a piece of text.

#### Multilingual Support
Multilingual support is a feature that allows the toolkit to process text in multiple languages.

### Advanced Analytics

#### Emotion Analysis
Emotion analysis is a technique used to identify the emotions expressed in a piece of text.

#### Intent Recognition
Intent recognition is a technique used to identify the intent or purpose behind a piece of text.

#### Semantic Analysis
Semantic analysis is a technique used to analyze the meaning of a piece of text.

#### Readability Scoring
Readability scoring is a technique used to measure the readability of a piece of text.

#### Text Statistics
Text statistics is a feature that provides statistical information about a piece of text such as word count, sentence count, and average sentence length.
